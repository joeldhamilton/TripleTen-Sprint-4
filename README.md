# TripleTen Sprint 4
# I will be using a table called 'vehicles_us.csv' to anaylyze data from a car advertising company.
# The Jupyter Notebook contains Experimental Data Analysis for the project.
# I plotted scatterplots and histograms for three hypotheses:
    # How cylinder count of a vehicle affects the price
    # How the price of a vehicle affects the length of time it's listed
    # How the mileage of a vehicle affects the price
# The findings for cylinder count are published to a Render.com webapp
